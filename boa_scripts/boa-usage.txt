1. Navigate to "https://boa.cs.iastate.edu/" on a web browser
2. Click "User Login (MSR)" on the side bar
3. On the pulled up webpage, select "request a user" if a user has not been registered yet. Otherwise, login at the side bar.
4. Click "Run Examples" on the side bar once you are logged in.
5. Copy and paste the code from "get_comment_changes.boa" found in this repository's "boa_scripts" folder
6. At the bottom of the page find the drop-down bar for "Input Dataset (use the SMALL dataset when testing queries!)", select "2021 Jan/ML-Verse"
7. Click run program, depending on the dataset size, it might take a while to complete. Once the query is done, you can "View Job Output" or "Download Job Output" at the top of the screen.

NOTE: the ML-Verse dataset is very large, so when the authors were running "get_comment_changes.boa", the dataset had to be partitioned and ran many times (for example, in one run only the 
repositories whose star count in the range of 0-10 were run, then another run stars 11-20 were ran). In the current version of "get_comment_changes.boa", only repos with 10 stars are ran. Change 
line 49 to specify how you wish to partition a run of the query. Because partitioning can be a very time-expensive process, we have combined the results of all partitioned queries into "1-output.txt"
which can be found on at our Zenodo: "https://zenodo.org/record/6975843#.YwpTYnbMK71".
