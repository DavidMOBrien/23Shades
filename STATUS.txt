This artifact is applying towards the three badges "Evaluated-Functional", "Evaluated-Reusable", 
and "Available" for the following reasons:

1: Evaluated-Functional - We have reproduced the data presented in our ESEC/FSE paper multiple times
using the provided instructions in the artifact, and have provided the documentation and datasets to
allow others to reproduce our results as well.

2: Evaluated-Reusable - We have split our dataset generation process into many reusable pieces, so that
future studies may reuse our entire process, or modify each individual stage to best fit their studies.

3: Available - Our data and scripts are available to the public on our GitHub repository.
