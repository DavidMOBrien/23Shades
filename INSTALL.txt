Once a default environment of Python 3 is installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or another
Python provider, a user can verify the correctness of installation by:

1. Download data from Zenodo dataset

2. Clone 23Shades GitHub repository

3. Move "1-output.txt" from downloaded Zenodo dataset to "python_scripts" folder in GitHub

4. Run "2-create_ids.py" with Python to create a "2-id_output.txt" file. User can then check that
the generated "2-id_output.txt" matches with the file of the same name on our Zenodo dataset.
